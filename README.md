# E08a-Paddle-Ball

Hey, Larry here.
Soooo... working with Godot.  It's proving to be pretty interesting!  Physics, collision, stuff like that.  I might enjoy this tool as I struggle to catch up and re-exist in this class.  (Funny thing, this is immediately following the Game Jam; I'm that far behind, and spoiler, my team and I worked on a space shooter using this platform.  It'll feel nice actually knowing what the fuck the programming side was all about, pardon my French.)

The goal here was to... well, mainly, do the exercise, and set up the basic workings of a Breakout game.  Honestly, just this experience alone was enough to help me get a good handle on this program, what with collision and physics and all.  Trying to learn how to match stuff on top of its designation for proper positioning was a little dumb, but the learning experience I took away from it in the end will be of great help to me.  Hopefully, I can make a pretty damn cool Breakout game with this as I advance.

# REVISION: E08b-Adding Tiles

Hey, Larry here.
It's fun.  Help.
Basically I did the things about adding tiles, but I did a bit of reordering because I basically thought the hotter the tile, the more points it's worth.  I messed up a bit and called the "Tiles" group "Gray Tiles" because I thought it would be joined by more groups, so then I basically had to changed the referenced script in Ball to fit it.  Here's to hoping "gray tiles" isn't confusing later at all!
Oh and also there are more tiles than intended because just 9 tiles per row felt too empty.

Basically the same as before.  Do I get to be overly ambitious again yet?

...just realized i really just added onto the first repository instead of doing this one.  WELL WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WILL JUST BE COPYPASTED FROM THAT REPOSITORY BECAUSE NOW IT WORKS STILL AFTER ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS, HA
